CSS is a web front end development language which has its basics, rules and how to add them to HTML. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language for styling the webpage. We can add CSS in an HTML file in 3 different ways. External CSS file, Internal CSS with <style> tag and Inline style. I can change the appearance and the layout of the webpage using External CSS file
